      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-me-content">
        I am Samuel Bazzi, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Boston University, where I have been working since July 2013. Alongside my current position, I hold several affiliations that contribute to my research and professional development. I am a Junior Affiliate at the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD) since 2015, a Member of the Urban Services Initiative at the Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL) since 2014, a Junior Faculty Fellow at the Hariri Institute for Computing since 2014, and a Faculty Affiliate at the Institute for Economic Development since 2013.
My educational background includes a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego, which I completed between 2008 and 2013. Prior to that, I earned an M.A. in Economics from the same institution in 2009 and a B.A., magna cum laude, from the University of Southern California between 2001 and 2005.
My primary research interests lie in the fields of Development, Growth, and Labor. I have published several articles in esteemed journals, such as the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, the American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, and the American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics. Some of my notable research includes topics like cash transfers and consumption smoothing in developing countries, the impact of economic shocks on conflict, and the identification of causes of economic growth.
In addition to my published work, I have ongoing research projects that explore various aspects of skill transferability, migration, and development. I am also involved in research examining the relationship between ethnic diversity and nation-building, the influence of Islamic institutions on structural change, and the estimation of productivity spillovers using production networks.
Throughout my career, I have been invited to deliver seminars and lectures at prestigious institutions, including Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University. I have also presented my research at numerous conferences, such as the NBER Economics of National Security Meeting and the NEUDC (Brown).
In terms of professional service, I have served as a referee for esteemed journals like the American Economic Review, Econometrica, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics. I have also participated in grant reviews for organizations like the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and have organized conferences and workshops, including the BREAD/NBER Pre-Conference Workshop for Junior Faculty.
My teaching experience encompasses a range of courses at Boston University, including Economics of Developing Countries (Undergraduate), Topics in Development Economics (Ph.D.), and Interdisciplinary Development Capstone (Masters). I have also been involved in conducting impact evaluation training institutes.
Throughout my career, I have been honored with grants and awards, including the PEDL/CEPR Special Exploratory Research Grant, the Upjohn Institute Early Career Research Award, and the Royal Economic Society Prize for the Best Paper Published in The Economic Journal in 2012.
In summary, I am a dedicated Assistant Professor of Economics with a passion for research in the areas of Development, Growth, and Labor. With an extensive publication record and ongoing projects, I strive to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in these fields.
